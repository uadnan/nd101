# Project 1: Your first neural network
My first neural network that is used to predict daily bike rental ridership as part of enrollment in Term 1 of Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation at Udacity.

# Dataset
Dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the `cnt` column. Dataset also ave information about temperature, humidity, and windspeed, all of these likely affecting the number of riders.
